        <h1>How overconsumptions affects our environment</h1>
        <p>Overconsumptions is the excessive use of resources beyond what’s necessary to meet basic needs. It’s driven
            by fast fashion, rapidly changing trends, and convenience-focused consumer culture. Overconsumption
            encourages people to buy more products at lower prices and replace them quickly. While this may support
            economic growth, it leads to waste, environmental degradation, and strain on global waste management
            systems. The trend to constantly stay up-to-date with trends can also affect mental health and our
            self-identity.

        <h2>Fast Fashion and Overconsumption</h2>
        <p>Fast fashion brands like H&M, Zara, and Forever 21 capitalize on the demand for affordable, trendy
            clothing. The global fast fashion market was valued at approximately $33 billion in 2022 and is
            projected to reach around $50 billion by 2027 (Statista, 2022). This exponential growth is primarily
            driven by consumer behavior that favors disposable trends over timeless quality.</p>

            <h2>Market share of the leading fast fashion companies U.S. 2020-2022</h2>
            <p>This chart shows how fast fashion is dominated by a few major brands, with Shein alone controlling half
                of the U.S. market. Its rapid growth reflects a shift toward ultra-fast fashion, where trends are
                produced quickly and sold at very low prices. Brands like Zara and H&M still play a major role, but the
                industry as a whole encourages frequent buying and disposable clothing, contributing to overconsumption
                and increased textile waste.</p>

        <h2>Global waste concerns</h2>
        <p>The World Bank projects that global waste generation will increase by 70% from 2020 levels
            by 2050, reaching a staggering 3.4 billion tons per year. This surge will put additional stress on waste
            management systems and contribute to pollution.
            Environmental Impact: Improper waste disposal can lead to soil and water contamination, harming ecosystems
            and human health. The increase in waste generation exacerbates these issues, especially in regions with
            inadequate waste management infrastructure. Overconsumption leads to the extraction of more raw materials,
            which can deplete natural
            resources and contribute to environmental degradation. The production of goods often requires significant
            energy and water. Below the chart will show global waste generation projections by 2070,</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overconsumption, driven by fast fashion and constant trends, encourages people to buy more than they need and
            discard clothing quickly. This behavior contributes to rising waste levels and increased environmental
            damage. Without changes in how we consume and produce goods, these impacts will continue to grow. Ways we
            can help include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy fewer, higher-quality items</li>
                <li>Choose secondhand or thrifted clothing</li>
                <li>Avoid trend-driven purchases</li>
                <li>Support more sustainable brands</li>
                <li>Reuse or donate clothing instead of throwing it away</li>
            </ul>
